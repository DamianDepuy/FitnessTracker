About me:
Damian Depuy 

Intro Assignment:
Up to this point, my experience with computers can go as far back as the early 90s. Because I am 36, I was lucky enough to experience the internet before AOL’s dialup. I remember using BBS to access games like Lord of The Red Dragon and other basic games that were limited but addicting. As more people started getting computers and the rise of AOL as a service, that is when I truly experienced the internet for the first time. I am familiar with Java as is the language being taught in my prior courses, but I have spent a little bit of time with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Although I have not practiced many other languages extensively, I have looked them over to see the differences in syntax and how they are used. I have taken Computer Architecture, CompSci 1 and 2, I took an introductory course in web programming that revolved around ruby on rails. 
I believe that there is always a use for building and creating my own web pages, or sites. Although I plan on finding a job in programming, I have always been an advocate for learning as many computer related skills as possible to broaden my knowledge and skillset. There’s always something new to learn, and the more I learn what’s available, the better I understand computer programming as a whole.
